# Bowling Project

This project aims to automate the aiming and firing system of a mini bowling alley.

## Idea and Development

This project is primarily developed in Python and C++ for Arduino.

The Python script is responsible for capturing an image using a webcam pointed at the bowling pins, identifying their positions, calculating the center of the pins, and determining the angle at which the bowling ball needs to be fired.

C++ is used to control the movement of the bowling ball pipe and activate the solenoid to launch the ball for a strike.
